# IST_Final_Proj_4320
The purpose of my app was to create a visually engaging and practical to-do list that helps people, especially college students, like me, stay organized. I’m someone who thrives on structure and enjoys checking things off throughout the day. It keeps me focused and gives me a sense of accomplishment. Since a lot of other students probably feel the same way, I wanted to build something simple, motivating, and actually useful.
For this project, I attempted to build the to-do list app using Python’s tkinter library. I focused on making the user interface clean and easy to follow. My main features included the ability to add tasks with categories and deadlines, save and load tasks, and check them off as completed. I also included a dropdown menu for task categories, and each category has its own color to help visually organize the list. To make the experience more enjoyable, I added random motivational quotes that appear when a task is added or when tasks are loaded into the app.
A lot of what I planned actually worked. The UI came together smoothly, the tasks display correctly, and users can mark tasks as done with checkboxes. Saving and loading tasks using a JSON file was successful, and the category-color mapping made the app more visually clear. Motivational quotes worked well and added a fun, personal touch.
That said, there were some things that didn’t work right away. I ran into an error when loading tasks from the saved file—it was treating the data as a list instead of a dictionary. I had to fix that by checking the data type before loading it. The delete button also didn’t work at first because the task selection wasn't mapped properly to the saved data. I was able to solve that by making sure the task ID in the backend matched the selected item in the UI.
There’s still more I’d like to add in the future. I think it would be helpful to highlight overdue tasks automatically. I’d also like to give users the ability to edit tasks after adding them, sort or filter the list by category or due date, and maybe even connect the app to a google/outlook calendar or add notifications. Long term, I’d love to make a mobile version or at least package the app as an executable so people could use it without needing Python installed.
Overall, I learned a lot from this project. I got more confident using tkinter, especially with laying out widgets and managing the user interface. I practiced working with JSON files and learned how to debug common issues with data handling and event responses. I also realized how much small design decisions—like colors, quotes, and button layout—can improve the user experience. I’m proud of how it turned out, and even though I’m still learning, it feels good to build something that’s both personal and functional.
